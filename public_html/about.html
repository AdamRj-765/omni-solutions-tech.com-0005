				<h2>Who Founded Us?</h2>

					Omni-Solutions Technology Consultants was founded in 2010 by ex-Symantec Enterprise Support Analyst, Adam Rodriguez. After experiencing many viral outbreaks, Microsoft compatibility issues, security gaps in various enterprise products, installation and enterprise product testing, thousands of inbound technical support phone calls, and remote management processes, Adam decided to take his expertise to a new level of consumer and enterprise support.

				<p class="dark">
					His new company would bring technical support to the forefront of user support and experience with the newest support tools to ensure customer satisfaction on all levels of information technology.
